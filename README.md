# Leaf
Leaf is the solution to all of my personal dev
problems, in a quite petite 3 lines of code.

It's a `$` function, but all it does is call
`$.mode` with the given parameters. As such, it
makes quite the perfect framework for building
just about anything.

## Leaf is under development!
I'm working on the ecosystem/documentation, as
it is a *very* small thing and can be hard to
grasp at first.

Check back soon!
